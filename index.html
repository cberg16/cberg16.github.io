        <p>Firstly, let us examine the model of the national ethno-state. This model relies on the foundational understanding of a state being based off of a singular racial or ethnic identity and can drastically range in degrees of scale on aspects of violence and imperialism. The concept of a race or ethnicity is artificial, an abstract construction based off of fictions meant to design communities. These constructions can be based off of skin tone, linguistics, faith, class, geography, etc.; A Pole is a Pole because they speak Polish, a White person is White because of their skin color, a Hutu is a Hutu because their ancestors where a part of a peasant class in feudal Rwandan society. These identities are crucial for the process of ethnocentrism, there has to be at the foundation of these polities an independent and unique identity which in its creation has an inherent aspect of exclusion. </p>
