        <p>this is my very first website! <b>(╯°□°)╯︵ ┻━┻</b></p>
        <p>This is a professional website for Karl Berg (Me!) geared towards people who are interested in either reaching out to me, 
            or for accessing and reading any of my work. I am currently a graduate student who is looking to get a Master's in public 
            policy, and I have a general interest in political economy, history, and international relations, including foreign policy.</p>
